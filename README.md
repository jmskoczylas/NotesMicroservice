# NotesMicroservice
This is a simple .Net 8.0 microservice for performing CRUD operations on notes. My intention for this project is to get a little bit of practice on Clean Architecture follwing guidelines set out by Jason Taylor in his article (see references).
# Todo
- Add Integration API tests solution.
- Add Integration SQL tests solution.
- Build simple front end for presentation purpouses.
